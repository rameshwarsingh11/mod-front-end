Test #2:

1. Go to mod #2 from localhost:3000/ or send-transfer.png and observe the design.
2. Add accessibility to the app.html, so that a screen reader can logically read the form sections and elements to the user.
3. Click the "Send" button at the bottom to display an alert and have the screen reader read the alert message.
